# Super Mario Bros Remake
This program is a remake of Super Mario Brothers, created for the final project of Google's 2020 Computer Science Summer Institute.  
  
Guide Mario safely through a classic 1980s map using the arrow keys while collecting coins and avoiding Goombas.
  
The main code is in map.js. The rest of the .js files are copies to save our progress. Created with Lucy Yao.
